      <description>Recently I have been going through some old code that I needed to rerun. As part of doing so I was taking the opportunity to reimplement it with some new tricks that I have discovered since I wrote it ~2 years ago.
This particular script has many, many for loops which I now wanted to replace with purrr::map to make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
As part of using purrr::map I wondered if I could also make the code go faster by parallelising the loop.</description>
