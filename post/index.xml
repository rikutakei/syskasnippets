      <description>Recently I have been going through some old code that I needed to rerun. As part of doing so I was taking the opportunity to reimplement it with some new tricks that I have discovered since I wrote it ~2 years ago.
This particular script has many, many for loops which I now wanted to replace with purrr::map to make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
As part of using purrr::map I wondered if I could also make the code go faster by parallelising the loop.</description>

      <description>One of the most useful additions to my .bashrc file that I have found is the addition of this command to save all the commands that I run into a log file.
export PROMPT_COMMAND=&amp;#39;if [ &amp;quot;$(id -u)&amp;quot; -ne 0 ]; then echo &amp;quot;$(date &amp;quot;+%Y-%m-%d.%H:%M:%S&amp;quot;) $(pwd) $(history 1)&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.logs/bash-history-$(date &amp;quot;+%Y-%m-%d&amp;quot;).log; fi&amp;#39; This is super useful because it saves a new file for each day of all of the timestamped commands that I have run and the directory I was in when I ran them.</description>

      <title>usethis - project setup</title>

      <description> One of the packages that was a highlight for me from rstudio::conf2018 was usethis.
This package forms part of the package building workflow but also general project workflows.
In a package development workflow some of the key functions are:
# creates a new dir and populates with a skeleton containing examples usethis::create_package(&amp;quot;/path/to/create/package&amp;quot;) # creates an R script in the R/ dir (don&amp;#39;t need to include the .R extension) usethis::use_r(&amp;quot;filename&amp;quot;) # series of license templates such as mit, gpl3, cc0 etc usethis::use_*_license_license(&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;) # initialises a testthat dir to put tests usethis::use_testthat() # creates a testfile usethis::use_test(&amp;quot;filename&amp;quot;) # creates a README file for your package usethis::use_readme_md() </description>

      <title>aRson threats and some best practices</title>

      <description>Recently on twitter - the source of most of these posts - Jenny Bryan (@JennyBryan) posted a link to her slides from her talk she gave in Auckland (http://bit.ly/jenny-nz). It inpsired threats of arson for people that use
setwd(&amp;quot;/absolute/path/to/file&amp;quot;)  (this was because it reduces portability and outside of you using it the chances of someone having the exact directory setup is basically 0%)
and
rm(list = ls())  (because it interferes with peoples sessions and doesn&amp;rsquo;t sort out other session issues such as packages already loaded)</description>

      <description>This came up in my twitter feed from Rbloggers and looks pretty useful as a set and forget type thing.
See https://www.r-bloggers.com/speeding-up-package-installation-2/ for the actual post
Basically, install.packages() uses the environment setting for Ncpus, which by default is set to 1.
The current setting can be found with
# the second argument returns 1 if Ncpus is not set, instead of NULL getOption(&amp;quot;Ncpus&amp;quot;, 1L) Ncpus can be set with this command before running install.</description>
